- ROBOCOPY:

After a quick wiki search, I found that `robocopy` is a windows command that has greater functionality than Xcopy. It stands for 'robust ile copy'.
Cool name. I wish it was a unix thing like `sl`.

- Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.:

I made another directory 1/2/3/Helloworld.md and then ran `cp -r 1 one` and it created another identical directory one/2/3/Helloworld.md

- Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

While the /temp directory, i ran `cp neat.txt ../` and it copy's neat.txt into the directory above. Do ../ this the appropiate number of times to `cp` the file into the home directory.

- Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

Done.
