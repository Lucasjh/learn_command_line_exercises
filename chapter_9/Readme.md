- Why can't you remove a directory with a blank file in it?

trying to run `rmdir` on a directory with a file in it gives an error: `Directory not empty`

- Can you touch blah.txt?

yes. It creates an empty .txt called blah.txt

- Let's create foo.txt

Done

- What happens when you touch an existing file?

from wikipedia: "touch is a standard Unix command-line interface program which is used to update the access date and / or modification date of a file or directory. In its default usage, it is the equivalent of creating or opening a file and saving it without any change to the file contents. Touch eliminates the unnecessary steps of opening the file, saving the file, and closing the file again. Instead it simply updates the dates associated with the file or directory. An updated access or modification date can be important for a variety of other programs such as backup utilities or the make command-line interface programming utility."

I guess it is like opening and saving the file to update the date of the file...
