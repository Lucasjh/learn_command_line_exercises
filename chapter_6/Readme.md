`ls -lR` seems to give a detailed list of all the items in a current directory with details about each item (timestamp, file type, etc)

What does `ls -lR` actually stand for?

What's in the tmp directory?

- `cd` into tmp and then `ls`

Can you show me what files are in that directory?

- Yes, with `ls`

What's in slash temp?

- based on a question in chapter_5, presumably a /log file. Why? I don't know.  (0 _ 0)
