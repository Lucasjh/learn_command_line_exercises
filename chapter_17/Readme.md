Can you show me all the files in slash temp slash foo?

`find tmp -name "*" -print`

What log files are in your log directory?

`find log -name "*.log" -print`

Run find in the class directory, pipe the output to pbcopy and create a gist with the content.  Paste the Gist URL as a comment on this story.

`find davinci_coders_t3_2015 -name "*.txt" -print > Search_on_class_directory.txt`

*Not sure what a pbcopy is or what a gist file is*
