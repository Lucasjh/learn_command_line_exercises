Chapter 2: pwd

1) What directory are you in? 

  I would run `pwd` and it would return:
  
    /Users/Apple/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2

2) Are you in the class directory? 

I would run `pwd` and it would show that i'm in the /chapter_2 directory. I am in a subdirectory 
of the class directory, not the class directory itself.

3) Are you in you home directory? 

No. I'm in a subdirectory of the class directory.

4) What directory did you run that command in? 

I ran `pwd` in the directory with this path:

    /Users/Apple/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2

To find the path to your current working directory in th GUI finder, open finder, and you can either do a search in the searchbar for Chapter_2, and look for the Readme.md in the folder or you can go to your home directory (In my case, the one called Apple) and click it then click through the path >workspace>davinci_coders...>homework>learn_comm...>chapter_2>Readme.md
