To find the path to your current working directory in th GUI finder,
Open finder, and you can either do a search in the searchbar for Chapter_2, and look for the Readme.md in the folder
Or you can go to your home directory (In my case, the one called Apple) and click it
Then click through the path >workspace>davinci_coders...>homework>learn_comm...>chapter_2>Readme.md
